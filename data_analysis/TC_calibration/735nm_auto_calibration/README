The 735nm project contains a calibration program that uses one of the TRC modules to take readings from a thermocouple.

IT WAS NOT USED FOR THE FINAL EXPERIMENT AS IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT THREE POINT CALIBRATION WERE NOT A GOOD CALIBRATION.
A 2ND ATTEMPT AT A TWO POINT CALIBRATION WAS ATTEMPTED USING A NEW XLSX FILE. THE VALUES WERE NOT A GOOD CALIBRATION.
(A TWO POINT CALIBRATION WAS PERFORMED MANUALLY TAKING THREE READINGS VS A REFERENCE THERMOMETER IN A WATER BATH.)

PROCEDURE
The name, reference temperature are entered while the TC is in the water bath
Starting the calibration the program takes consecutive readings until a threshold is reached for delta T (specified by the user)
The information is sent to a 735nm data logger module and stored on a microSD card. 
These data are downloaded in the folders for three different reference temperatures in the 24C, 33C and 60C folders.

1st attempt
The CSV text data was loaded into the calibration_coef.ods spread sheet and an average of the readings was calculated.

These were turned into coef for creating a three point calibration.

The information on the "coef" sheet is the consolidated view of the calibration readings. Calculations were performed for spot checking.
The equations and coef that were calculated and tried using the TC connected to the TRC module and placed in a water bath did not result in any reliable readings.

2nd attempt
Values were then put into a new "TC_individual_calibration_coef.xlsx" file where each TC was broken into its own sheet.
Data for 24C and 33C values were graphed and the coef from the equation were used for calibration values in the 735nm TRC code.
These values did not perform any better and not used in this experiment.

3rd attempt
Values were manually taken, three TC readings vs reference from thermometer, two reference values ~25C and ~35C.
These data points were then put into an spread sheet and the standard equation to calculate slope and intercept were calculated as coef.
These new coef were used in the experiment.


DISCUSSION
This process should have worked if values were retaken as a two point calibration with different analysis.
It is unclear why the recorded data was unable to create coef for the 735TRC program to take reliable, accurate measurements of supsequent water baths vs thermometer references.
It could be the user defined tollerance for temperature variation in TC readings was too tight.

Due to time constraints, it was decided that the amount of TC and readings that needed to be taken were easier to perform manually in a lab book with subsequent calculations of the coef in a spread sheet.
Instead of graphing the points, an equation for calculating the slope and intercept were used.
These manual readings performed better. Consistent and relative accuracy among all TC. These were used in the experiment.
