20230811 data collection top of mountain

ERRORS
The power was disconeccted at some point so there is missing data
RTC battery failed so some date/times are not reliable

All files were copied from SD card but had been read once on a MAC from a student. There are additional files that are not needed because of that. Files that do not start with a period "." are sensor data.
